Day 2 Quiz
----------

1. What is a for loop best suited to do?
Iterating through lists and other containers which have a length prop:
The number of iterations is known in advance.
In a Python for loop the stop condition is not exposed

2. What is a while loop best suited for?
For Iterating
    using a counter
    or when the number of iterations is NOT known in advance

3. When will an optional else clause after a loop run? (any loop, for or while)
Loop must have run to completion.

4. In a function definition, what syntax denotes 
the block of code that is the body of the function?
:
indentation

5. What is the keyword required to exit from this loop:

while True:
    # some code
    break

break # won't work, outside loop

alternately, you could have a separate loop control variable
more = True
while more:
    # some code
    more = False
more suited if there are several ways of getting out of the loop 
and any one of them can set more to False

6. Differentiate between a module and a script, in broad terms only.
A module may contain functions and classes
It can be imported into a script 
and the functions and classes may be called from the script
Modules de-couple runtime code 
so we may use the functions and classes as we see function
and re-use them in other scripts
without duplicating code

7. If a function has a return statement, can any code come after that line?
No (in the same block)

def ask_my_name():
    name = input("What's your name?)
    if len(name):
        return name
    return None

8. If a function has input, what is this called at function definition time?
parameters

9. If a function has input, what is this called at runtime?
arguments

10. What, if anything, do we know in Python from a function definition, 
about the datatypes of the parameters to a function 
(without any custom validation code)?
NOTHING
types are set by the data itself

def ask_my_name_and_age(name, age):
    pass
