Day 3 Quiz

----------
 
1. Which function is pure, a or b?
b - a has no input, but it does depend on thingb has input parameter which passes in a COPY of thing
the binding to thing is broken at that point
 
thing = 1

def a():

    print(thing)
 
def b(thing):

    print(thing)
 
2. Which of the two functions below has a closure? Note that both functions compile and run.
a 


def outer_a():

    lst = []

    def add_to_lst(item):

        nonlocal lst

        lst.append(item)

        return lst

    return add_to_lst
 
lst = []

def outer_b():

    def add_to_lst(item):

        global lst

        lst.append(item)

        return lst

    return add_to_lst
 
3. How does one access the attributes and methods of an object?
dot notation
 
4. Class names should be in what style?
CamelCase
 
5. Which dunder method is called (indirectly) when you FIRST create an object of a class?
__init__
 
6. The first param. of each method in a class is conventionally named self. To what does this param. refer?
the class itself: instantiated as the current object (instance of the class) under construction
 
7. How many objects are created in the following 2 LOC?
only 1 in both lines
second one is copying a reference

class_a = ClassA() 

class_b = class_a
 
8. Which dunder method should we override in our own custom classes 

to obtain a meaningful representation of our objects' properties, 

once we have made the object?

__str__
 
9. Write a *list slice* to return a new list with every other (even) number from the following list:

nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

print(even_nums := nums[1::2])
OR
print(even_nums := nums[1:9:2])

10. Using *list comprehension*, return a list from the same list, nums, with just the numbers 5 or less

small_nums = [num for num in nums if num < 5] # a different condition (Predicate) substituted
 like a for loop on one line, with a filter passed in
 filter: FP term, applies atest to every element in a list (or tuple),
 returns only those that pass the test and writes them to a NEW list
 IMMUTABLE method
 similar: map, takes EVERY element of a list (or tuple) and applies a transformation
 returns ALL the transformed elements as a new list
 in both cases, the original list is unaffected
