# Python Programmer 

## PYP1-JAN25-1

### January 2025

The course was disrupted on Friday 24th January during Storm Eowyn.

Here is the code to date, including the session delivered on backup battery and UPS.

The rest of the content will be covered at a date to be arranged which is mutually convenient, therefore I have ***NOT uploaded*** anything else here, in order not to "jump the gun".

In preparation for resuming the delivery, it might be good idea to read ahead in the PDF manual for the following sessions:

- 08-12 Containers (in brief, already covered)

- 13 Modules (in brief, already covered)

- 14 Pattern matching

- 15 Exception handling

- 16 File handling (in brief, already covered)

- 17 Databases
